# C++ QT Snake

A basic snake game written in C++ with QT for the GUI.

## Directions

To move the snake around, you can either use the arrow keys or WASD. The head of the snake, body of the snake, and food will be represented by the characters 'H', 'X', and 'O' respectively.

The snake starts off at a length of three and grows by one with each piece of food eaten. The goal is to get as long as possible.

You die whenever you either run into yourself or into a wall which will result in a gameover.
